The goal of the project is to predict the level of difficulty of a sentence in French language. Difficulty levels include A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2.
There is some training data given in order to train the model which is done with 80% of this data. The leftover randomly chosen 20% is used for testing. Additioanlly, there is also some unlabelled test data that the model was tested on to achieve some general metrics associated with the testing. These metrics include precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy.
Before cosnidering deeper analysis of this project, pre-developed classifiers were implemented into predcition, including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Metric results of these classifiers are included in the table. KNN performs the worst among the classifiers in this scenario. KNN's performance might suffer due to its reliance on the local structure of the data. It may not capture complex relationships between features effectively in this context, leading to poorer performance compared to other algorithms. Decision Tree performs similarly to KNN but slightly better.Decision Trees are prone to overfitting, especially with high-dimensional data like text. This might lead to poorer generalization and performance on unseen data. Random Forest outperforms KNN and Decision Tree. Random Forests mitigate overfitting by combining multiple decision trees through ensemble learning. This allows them to capture more complex relationships in the data and generalize better. Logistic Regression performs the best among the classifiers. Logistic Regression is well-suited for binary classification tasks and can be effective in multiclass classification when used with techniques like one-vs-rest or multinomial logistic regression. It's likely that Logistic Regression's linear decision boundary is effective in capturing the patterns in the data, resulting in better performance. Logistic Regression outperforms other classifiers in this scenario, likely due to its ability to model the relationship between features and the target variable effectively.
